# Lenovo Predicting Customer Sentiment

Through this project an attempt has been made to help Lenovo predict the customer satisfaction for their products with the help of customer sentiment data. Net Promoter Score (NPS) is a key indicator of a product or company’s performance in the market.

**Problem Statement**: Lenovo currently uses customers’ responses to the Net Promoter Score (NPS) survey as their primary measurement of customer satisfaction, but feedback from the NPS survey results arrives rather late in the product life cycle. 

**Objective**: To address the customers’ concerns in a timely fashion, Lenovo would like to understand them based on the discussion customers have on the web regarding their products. They would like to be able to predict NPS score based on the customer sentiment.

Having an NPS score would give an idea of where the product, and the company in general, stands among the public. Higher Net Promoter Scores tend to indicate a healthier business, while lower Net Promoter Scores can be an early warning to dig deeper into potential customer satisfaction and loyalty issues.

**Data:**
The following key information was provided by Lenovo to help to identify the relationship between customer sentiment and NPS:
* Sentiment Data: Information collected from web scrapes and third-party apps which had data regarding the following:
	- Comment ID
	- Sentiments that the software recognized and allotted to various product features in that comment
	- Levels of classification of the product features
	- Product name
	- Date (MM/DD/YYYY)
	- Star Rating assigned by the customer
* Survey Data: Official survey responses to many questions important among which are:
	- Survey ID & date (MM/DD/YYYY)
	- Product & Brand NPS
	- Product name & Series
	- Additional questions like satisfaction levels with various features, service aspects, purchase process, etc.
